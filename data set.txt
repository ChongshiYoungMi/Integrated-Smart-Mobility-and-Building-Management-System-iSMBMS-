Project Title:
    Integrated Smart Monitoring and Building Management System (ISMBMS)
________________________________________


Abstract:
   Phase 5 culminates in the complete integration and demonstration of the ISMBMS‚Äîa unified IoT-based platform that combines smart building automation, fleet management, predictive maintenance, and real-time mobile control. The system utilizes interconnected sensors and cloud infrastructure to automate environmental controls, monitor fleet performance, and predict equipment failures before they occur. A mobile dashboard allows remote access to building systems and telematics data, supporting fast, data-driven decisions. Studies show that predictive maintenance can reduce equipment downtime by nearly 50%, while IoT-based building automation enhances energy efficiency and occupant comfort. ISMBMS eliminates operational silos by consolidating facility and fleet management under a single intelligent framework.
