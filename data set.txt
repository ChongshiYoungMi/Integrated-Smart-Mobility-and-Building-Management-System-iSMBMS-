Project Title:
    Integrated Smart Monitoring and Building Management System (ISMBMS)
________________________________________


Abstract:
   Phase 5 culminates in the complete integration and demonstration of the ISMBMS—a unified IoT-based platform that combines smart building automation, fleet management, predictive maintenance, and real-time mobile control. The system utilizes interconnected sensors and cloud infrastructure to automate environmental controls, monitor fleet performance, and predict equipment failures before they occur. A mobile dashboard allows remote access to building systems and telematics data, supporting fast, data-driven decisions. Studies show that predictive maintenance can reduce equipment downtime by nearly 50%, while IoT-based building automation enhances energy efficiency and occupant comfort. ISMBMS eliminates operational silos by consolidating facility and fleet management under a single intelligent framework.
 


A. Project Demonstration

Overview
   The final integrated system is demonstrated to stakeholders, showcasing full functionality across building automation, vehicle tracking, maintenance prediction, and mobile control. This phase verifies that all modules are synchronized and ready for deployment. Stakeholders evaluate the usability and performance of the platform.


Demonstration Details
 •System Dashboard: Displays real-time data from buildings (temperature, humidity, energy) and fleets (vehicle speed, GPS, fuel level).
 •Mobile Interface: Remote control of devices like HVAC and lighting through a secure mobile app.
 •Fleet Telematics: Live tracking of vehicles with route optimization and maintenance alerts.
 •Predictive Maintenance: Simulated sensor anomalies (e.g., vibration, temperature rise) trigger alerts for preventive repairs.
 •Cloud Connectivity: All sensor data flows through Firebase or equivalent, allowing seamless integration and global accessibility.


Outcome
 •All integrated features perform successfully.
 •Demonstration confirms real-time responsiveness and control.
 •Stakeholders approve the project for documentation and final submission.
